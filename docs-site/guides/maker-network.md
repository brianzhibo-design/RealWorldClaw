# Maker Network Guide

The RealWorldClaw Maker Network is a decentralized manufacturing network — **Uber for 3D printing**.

## How It Works

1. **User** places an order (design + location)
2. **Platform** matches the nearest available maker
3. **Maker** prints, assembles, and ships
4. **User** confirms delivery and rates

## Roles

| Role | What You Do | What You Earn |
|------|------------|---------------|
| 🖨️ Printer | Print structures with your idle printer | Per-piece fee |
| 🔧 Assembler | Assemble modules + structures | Assembly service fee |
| 🎨 Designer | Create new reference designs | Download royalties |

## Privacy

- Buyers and makers never see each other's identity
- All communication is anonymized through the platform
- Location data is limited to city-level for matching

## Commission

- **Normal orders:** 15% platform fee
- **Express orders:** 20% platform fee
- Makers receive 80-85% of the order value

## Become a Maker

```bash
rwc maker register
```
