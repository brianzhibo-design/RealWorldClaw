# Designing for 3D Printing

Best practices for designing RealWorldClaw-compatible 3D printed structures.

## Recommended Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Material | PLA (default), PETG (outdoor) |
| Layer Height | 0.2mm |
| Infill | 15-20% |
| Wall Loops | 3 |
| Supports | Auto where needed |

## Design Guidelines

- Follow the 1U (20×20mm) grid system
- Include module mounting slots with magnet recesses
- Design for FDM printability — no overhangs >45° without supports
- Test-fit with tolerance of ±0.2mm
