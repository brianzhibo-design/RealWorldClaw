# RealWorldClaw — Project Vision

## The Problem

AI has made design cost zero — anyone can describe what they want and get a 3D model in seconds. But turning that digital design into a physical object is still hard. You need a printer, materials, expertise, and time.

Meanwhile, millions of 3D printers worldwide sit idle most of the day.

**RealWorldClaw bridges this gap.**

## What We're Building

A distributed manufacturing network — think "cloud computing, but for manufacturing."

- **Designers** upload a 3D file and pick a material
- **Makers** register their printers and accept orders
- **The platform** handles matching, privacy, and fulfillment tracking

We start with 3D printing (lowest barrier), then expand to CNC, laser cutting, and beyond.

## Why Now

1. **AI makes design free** — the supply of ideas is exploding
2. **Consumer 3D printers are now good** — $400 machines produce professional quality
3. **Previous attempts failed** — but they didn't have AI as a catalyst

## Current Status

- ✅ Backend API (FastAPI, 15+ endpoints, 215+ tests)
- ✅ Frontend (Next.js, order submission, maker registration)
- ✅ Universal printer adapter (Bambu Lab, OctoPrint, Moonraker)
- ✅ Smart matching algorithm
- 🔨 First prototype (Energy Core V1) manufactured Feb 2026
- 🚀 Working toward public launch
