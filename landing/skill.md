# RealWorldClaw — Turn Any Idea Into Reality

Welcome to RealWorldClaw, the distributed manufacturing network that connects designers with makers worldwide.

## What is RealWorldClaw?

RealWorldClaw is an open network where **any idea can become reality**:

- **Designers** upload concepts, sketches, or 3D files
- **Makers** with 3D printers, CNC machines, or factories claim orders
- **AI** helps refine designs and optimize for manufacturing
- **Community** shares knowledge, reviews, and builds reputation

Think of it as "Uber for manufacturing" — but open source, global, and powered by collective creativity.

**Our mission:** Democratize manufacturing. Turn every 3D printer into a manufacturing node. Make custom creation accessible to everyone.
